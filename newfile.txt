# How to Create a New Repository and Add Files to GitHub

This guide explains how to create a new repository, add files, and push them to GitHub step-by-step.



## Step 1: Create a Local Repository

1. Open your terminal (e.g., Git Bash, PowerShell).
2. Create a new directory and navigate into it:
   
   mkdir Gitcmd
   cd Gitcmd
  
3. Initialize an empty Git repository:
 
   git init
   



## Step 2: Add Files to the Repository

1. Add files you want to include in the repository:
   - You can create files manually or use the following command to create a sample README file:
   
     echo "# Gitcmd Repository" > README.md
    
2. Add all files to the staging area:
  
   git add .
   
3. Commit the files with a descriptive message:
   
   git commit -m "Initial commit"
   



## Step 3: Connect to the Remote Repository

1. Add your GitHub repository as the remote:
  
   git remote add origin git@github.com:ThantNyi/Gitcmd.git
   
2. Verify the remote link:
   
   git remote -v
   



## Step 4: Push to GitHub

1. Push the files to the `main` branch of the remote repository:
   
   git branch -M main
   git push -u origin main
  



## Step 5: Verify on GitHub

1. Visit your repository at `https://github.com/ThantNyi/Gitcmd`.
2. Confirm that your files have been uploaded successfully.
